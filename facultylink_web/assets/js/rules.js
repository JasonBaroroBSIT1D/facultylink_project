  evaluationPeriod: "August 1, 2023 – July 31, 2026",
  formula: "Final Score = Base Points × Contribution Percentage",
  formulaNote: "For an output with two or more claimants, each faculty declares a contribution percentage on the prescribed Certificate of Contribution form. Points received equal the points allocated for the indicator multiplied by that percentage. A sole author, sole inventor, or sole developer is credited the full base points.",
  globalConditions: [
    "Faculty are evaluated on Instruction; Research, Innovation and/or Creative Work; Extension; and Professional Development within the evaluation period (August 1, 2023 – July 31, 2026, and succeeding three-year cycles unless CHED and DBM provide otherwise).",
    "Only performance and accomplishments within the prescribed evaluation period are given points.",
    "There shall be no double counting of points. A single document used for one indicator cannot be used for another, unless specifically permitted (for example, a paper presented and published in an indexed journal in the same period may earn both presentation and research points).",
    "Outputs must be aligned with the faculty member’s field of specialization or allied field, unless otherwise specified.",
    "All declarations must be supported by the documentary evidence required under the circular.",
    "The SUC governing board has the final authority on reclassification decisions. FacultyLink does not replace that decision."
